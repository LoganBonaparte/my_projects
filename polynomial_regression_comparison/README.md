# Deep Learning vs Polynomial Regression for Noisy Data
This project compares deep learning and traditional polynomial regression techniques to fit noisy polynomial data. A neural network model built with TensorFlow is trained to predict the underlying polynomial function, while a traditional polynomial regression model using scikit-learn is also fitted to the data. The models are evaluated based on mean squared error, and their performances are visualized to demonstrate how each approach handles noisy data.

## Key Features:
Neural network model for polynomial regression built with TensorFlow.
Polynomial regression model using scikit-learn.
Model evaluation with mean squared error.
Visual comparison of both models' predictions on noisy data.
