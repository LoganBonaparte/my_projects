## Deep Learning for Nonlinear Optimization

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning to solve nonlinear optimization problems. The goal is to minimize a complex objective function with multiple variables. 
Using TensorFlow, I developed a neural network that learns to predict the optimal solution for these types of problems.
The model is trained on synthetic data representing nonlinear functions, and its performance is compared against traditional optimization methods like gradient descent. 
This project showcases how deep learning can be applied to solve optimization challenges that are typically difficult for conventional algorithms.
