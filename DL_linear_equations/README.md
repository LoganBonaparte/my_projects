## Deep Learning for Solving Linear Equations
This project explores how deep learning can be used to solve systems of linear equations of the form (Ax = b), where (A) is a matrix and (b) is a vector. 
Using TensorFlow, I built a neural network that learns to predict the solution vector (x) given the matrix (A) and vector (b) as inputs.

The idea is to train the model on a synthetic dataset of linear systems, and then test how well it can predict the solution on unseen data. 
Itâ€™s a fun demonstration of applying AI to solve mathematical problems!

## Key Features:
A neural network model built with TensorFlow.
Synthetic dataset generation for training and testing.
Model performance evaluation and predictions.
Visual comparison of predicted vs. actual solutions.
